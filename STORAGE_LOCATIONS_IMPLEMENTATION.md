# Custom Storage Locations Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a feature that allows users to add custom storage locations when they select "Other" from the storage location dropdown. These custom locations are persisted using localStorage and will be available for future use.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`src/hooks/useStorageLocations.tsx`** - Custom hook that manages storage locations
2. **`src/components/StorageLocationSelect.tsx`** - Reusable component for storage location selection
3. **`STORAGE_LOCATIONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - This documentation file

### Modified Files
1. **`src/components/AddItemForm.tsx`** - Updated to use new StorageLocationSelect component
2. **`src/components/EditItemForm.tsx`** - Updated to use new StorageLocationSelect component  
3. **`src/components/MoveToInventoryModal.tsx`** - Updated to use new StorageLocationSelect component
4. **`src/components/PhotoAnalysisEditForm.tsx`** - Updated to use new StorageLocationSelect component

## How It Works

### Storage Location Hook (`useStorageLocations.tsx`)
- Manages default storage locations and custom user-added locations
- Persists custom locations to localStorage with key `'custom-storage-locations'`
- Provides functions to add/remove custom locations
- Prevents duplicate locations (case-insensitive)
- Returns a combined list with "Other" always at the end

### Storage Location Select Component (`StorageLocationSelect.tsx`)
- Replaces the hardcoded storage location selects in all forms
- When user selects "Other", shows an input field for custom location
- Validates custom input and provides user feedback via toast notifications
- Supports keyboard shortcuts (Enter to add, Escape to cancel)
- Automatically adds the custom location to the persistent list when confirmed

### User Experience
1. User selects "Other" from the storage location dropdown
2. An input field appears with "Add" and "Cancel" buttons
3. User types their custom location name
4. User clicks "Add" or presses Enter to confirm
5. The custom location is added to the list and selected
6. Future forms will include this custom location in the dropdown
7. Custom locations persist across browser sessions

## Features
- **Persistence**: Custom locations are saved to localStorage and persist across sessions
- **Validation**: Prevents empty or duplicate locations
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm successful additions or show errors
- **Keyboard Support**: Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel
- **Case Insensitive**: Duplicate checking ignores case differences
- **Centralized Management**: Single hook manages all storage locations
- **Reusable Component**: All forms use the same StorageLocationSelect component

## Technical Benefits
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated code duplication across 4 components
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for storage locations
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add features like location deletion or editing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Performance**: localStorage is fast and doesn't require server calls

## Future Enhancements
The implementation is designed to easily support future features like:
- Ability to delete custom storage locations
- Import/export of storage location lists
- Storage location categories or grouping
- Server-side storage location sync (if user accounts are implemented)
- Storage location usage analytics

## Usage
The feature is automatically available in all food item forms:
- Add Item Form
- Edit Item Form  
- Move to Inventory Modal
- Photo Analysis Edit Form

Users simply select "Other" from any storage location dropdown and follow the prompts to add their custom location.
