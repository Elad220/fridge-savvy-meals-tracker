# Toast Notification Fix Summary

## Problem
When moving items to inventory, multiple toast notifications were being triggered simultaneously, causing them to override each other and making users miss important events.

## Root Cause
1. **Toast Limit**: The toast system was configured with `TOAST_LIMIT = 1`, meaning only one toast could be displayed at a time
2. **Multiple Operations**: The `handleMoveToInventory` function triggered multiple operations that each showed their own toast:
   - `consumeIngredients()` - showed toasts for consumed/insufficient ingredients
   - `addFoodItem()` - showed a toast for "Food item added"
   - Other potential toasts from various operations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Increased Toast Limit
- Changed `TOAST_LIMIT` from 1 to 3 in `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`
- Changed `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY` from 1000000ms to 5000ms for better UX

### 2. Consolidated Toast Messages
- Modified `consumeIngredients()` to return results instead of showing toasts immediately
- Updated `handleMoveToInventory()` to show a single comprehensive toast message
- Added `suppressToast` parameter to `addFoodItem()` to prevent duplicate toasts

### 3. Improved Toast Content
The new consolidated toast shows:
- **Success**: "Meal moved to inventory. Successfully consumed ingredients: [list]"
- **Partial Success**: "Meal moved to inventory. Consumed: [list]. Missing: [list]"
- **No Ingredients**: "Meal moved to inventory. No ingredients consumed. Missing: [list]"
- **Simple Move**: "Meal moved to inventory. Meal plan successfully moved to inventory."

## Benefits
1. **No More Overlapping Toasts**: Users will see all relevant information in a single, clear message
2. **Better User Experience**: Comprehensive feedback about what happened during the move operation
3. **Reduced Toast Spam**: Eliminates multiple rapid-fire notifications
4. **Clearer Information**: Users can see both consumed and missing ingredients in one place

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Increased toast limit and reduced delay
- `src/hooks/useFoodItems.tsx` - Added suppressToast parameter
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Consolidated toast logic in handleMoveToInventory
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript type issues with DashboardWindow

## Testing
The fix ensures that when users move meal plans to inventory:
1. Only one comprehensive toast is shown
2. All relevant information (consumed/missing ingredients) is included
3. The toast doesn't get overridden by other notifications
4. Users can clearly understand what happened during the operation
