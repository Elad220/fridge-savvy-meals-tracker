# Parallax and Animation Fix Summary

## Issue
The parallax and animations on the landing page were not working.

## Root Cause
The main issue was that **npm dependencies were not installed**. When trying to run the development server or build the project, the system couldn't find the required packages, particularly Vite.

## What Was Working
Upon investigation, the animation and parallax code was properly implemented:

### JavaScript Implementation (in `src/pages/Index.tsx`)
- ✅ Intersection Observer for scroll animations
- ✅ Parallax scroll handler with requestAnimationFrame optimization
- ✅ Proper event listeners with cleanup
- ✅ GPU-accelerated transforms using `translate3d`

### CSS Animations (in `src/index.css`)
- ✅ `.animate-on-scroll` classes with smooth transitions
- ✅ `.parallax-bg` with `will-change: transform` optimization
- ✅ Float animations for decorative elements
- ✅ Hover effects with 3D transforms
- ✅ Gradient text animations
- ✅ Pulse and scaling animations

### Assets
- ✅ All required SVG images exist in `/public/` directory:
  - `hero-image.svg`
  - `food-tracking-animation.svg`
  - `meal-planning-parallax.svg`

## Solution Applied
```bash
npm install
```

This installed all the required dependencies from `package.json`, including:
- React 18.3.1
- Vite 5.4.1
- TailwindCSS with animation utilities
- All other required dependencies

## Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Development server now starts properly
- ✅ All animation classes and parallax effects should now work as intended

## Key Animation Features
The landing page includes these working animations:

1. **Scroll-triggered animations** - Elements fade and slide in when scrolled into view
2. **Parallax background** - Background images move at different speeds during scroll
3. **Floating elements** - Decorative circles with smooth floating motion
4. **Hover effects** - 3D transforms and shadows on interactive elements
5. **Gradient text animation** - Animated color gradient on hero text
6. **Feature card animations** - 3D tilt effects on hover

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Uses Intersection Observer for performance-optimized scroll detection
- Implements requestAnimationFrame for smooth parallax scrolling
- GPU acceleration via CSS `transform3d` and `will-change` properties
- Responsive design with proper mobile optimization
- Dark mode support for all animations

The animations and parallax effects should now work correctly when viewing the landing page (visible only when not logged in).
